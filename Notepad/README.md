# 251-Assignment1-2021-Chris-Holly 
## **Chris McDonald** (*20009360*), **Holly Ducoing** (*20012507*)
### **How to run**
#### All features can be accessed directly from the main window.
#### The following text file formats can be read and opened by the text editor: *.txt*, *.rtf*, *.odt*
#### The following source code formats can be read and opened by the text editor: *.java*, *.py*, *.cpp*, *.html*, *.xml*
#### The above source code formats are colour coded by their respective syntax.
#### Text in the main window can be saved to either *.txt* or *.pdf* format, depending on which menu button is clicked.
#### Both are automatically assigned their file types. Saving to PDF creates a file My_PDF.pdf in the directory where the root folder is. Saving to .txt requires the user to select the location and the file name. Adding a .txt suffix when saving is not necessary, the function does that automatically.
#### Search allows the user to search for a single word. If found, all instances of the word in the document will be highlighted. If not, a popup window will inform the user that their search was unsuccessful.
## Significant commit ID's
### Chris:
#### 72b3770, f94aee8, e7a09f6
### Holly:
### 8e61c59, 6938811, 88bf11f
## Interesting features:
#### We elected to give our text editor a colour scheme similar to that of *The Matrix*, to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
